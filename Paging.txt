Paging is a memory management scheme used by operating systems to manage and allocate memory efficiently. It divides a program's memory into fixed-size blocks, known as "pages," which are stored in the physical memory's corresponding "page frames" When a program runs, only the required pages are loaded into memory, which makes paging especially useful in managing limited RAM resources effectively.

Advantages of Paging

Efficient Memory Management
Paging allows the system to use memory more efficiently by loading only the necessary pages into physical memory, reducing the need to load entire programs at once.

Flexibility in Program Execution
Paging enables processes to be split across multiple memory locations, allowing programs to use more memory than is physically available by loading and swapping pages as needed.

Simplified Memory Allocation
Because pages and frames are of fixed size, memory allocation becomes simpler, with less need for complex calculations to find appropriate memory slots for data.

Disadvantages of Paging
Overhead of Page Tables
Paging requires maintaining a page table, which maps logical pages to physical frames. This can consume additional memory and CPU resources, especially for large processes.

Slower Access Due to Page Faults
When a required page is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs, which requires loading the page from secondary storage (e.g., disk) into RAM. This can slow down program execution significantly.

Increased Latency
Paging introduces a delay in memory access, as the system must look up the page table to find the corresponding physical address before accessing data.

Internal Fragmentation
Although paging reduces external fragmentation, it can lead to internal fragmentation. Since pages are fixed in size, a program may not use up the entire page, leaving unused space within a page.

Complexity in Implementation
Paging requires careful management of page tables and memory mapping, which adds complexity to the operating system's design and handling of memory.
